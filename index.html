    <p>
      This specification describes a browser API to enable developers signal the priorities of the resources they need to download.

      This is an unofficial proposal.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>
  The browser's resource loading process is a complex one. Browsers discover needed resources and download them according to
  their heuristic priority. Browsers may also use this heuristic resource priority to delay sending certain requests in order
  to avoid bandwidth contention of these resources with more critical ones.</p>

<p>Currently web developers have very little control over the heuristic importance of loaded resources, other than speeding
  up their discovery using
  <code>&lt;link rel=preload&gt;</code>. Browsers make many assumptions on the importance of resources based on the resource's type (AKA its request destination),
  and based on its location in the containing document.</p>

<p>This document will detail use cases and a markup sketch that will provide developers with the control to indicate a
  resource's relative importance to the browser, and enable the browser to act on those indications to modify the time it
  sends out the request and its HTTP/2 dependency/weight so that important resources are fetched and used earlier, in order
  to improve the user's experience.</p>

  </section>
<section>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>


<p>Async JavaScript files may be loaded by default with low priority, but some of them may be of high priority and should
    be loaded at the same time as the page's render blocking resources. Developers currently use
    <a href="https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/900445266750263296">hacks</a> to address that use-case.</p>
<div class="example" title="Example 1">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have a web app with a mix of async scripts that are critical and non-critical to the initial experience. They want to signify the importance of these resources to the browser. They can accomplish this by annotating these requests with the `importance` attribute:
      </p>
      <p>The browser will attempt to fetch main.js with a high priority and the other scripts with a lower priority.</p>
  <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script src=&quot;main.js&quot; async importance=&quot;high&quot; /&gt; 

&lt;script src=&quot;non-critical-1.js&quot; async importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;non-critical-2.js&quot; async importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt;
  </pre>
</div>


    <p>
      <p>Third-party resources (e.g scripts from ads) are often loaded with medium/high priority, but developers may wish to load
      them all at low priority. Similarly, developers may wish to load all first-party resources that are critical with a high
      priority.</p>
    <div class="example" title="Example 2">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have a page that includes a number of 
        <b>third-party</b> resources which are not-critical to first paint. They would like to signify to the browser that the importance
        of these resources is low so that requests for them don't content with other network requests for more important resources. They can accomplish this by annotating these requests with an `importance` of `low`:
      </p>
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script src=&quot;https://foo.com/non-critical.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt; 

&lt;script src=&quot;https://foo.com/ads.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt; 

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://foo.com/footer.css&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>
  </p>
  

    <p>
      <p>Markup images are typically loaded with low priority, but may be critical to the user experience, so for certain images,
      the developer may want to indicate that their importance only falls short of the page's render blocking resources. A prominent
      example of that is the page's image in an image sharing site, where the image is the main content users are looking for.
      Another example is a single-page-app where route fetches must run at highest priority.
      </p>
      <div class="example" title="Example 3">
        <p>FastCorp Inc. have an image sharing section of their site where individual images have their own dedicated pages. Although there are several resources loaded for each of these pages, the image is the main content users are interested in. Related images are the next most important. They want to indicate this importance to the browser.
        </p>
        <pre highlight="html">
 
&lt;main&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&quot;family.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;/main&gt; 

&lt;section id=&quot;related&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;graduation.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;/&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&quot;wedding.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt; 
&lt;script src=&quot;social-buttons.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt; 

&lt;script src=&quot;analytics.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;/&gt;
          </pre>
      </div>
    </p>

<ul>


  <li>Blocking scripts are often of high priority (depends on their location in the page and other heuristics), yet sometimes
    developers want to avoid them interfering with e.g. loading of viewport images.</li>

  <li>When developers download a group of resources as a result of user interaction, those resources download priorities don't
    take into account the eventual usage and importance of those resources. Developers may wish to load these resources with
    priorities and dependencies which better represent their usage and the user's needs</li>

  <li>Single-page applications can kick off multiple API requests to bootstrap the user experience. Developers may wish to load
    critical API requests at a high priority and have better control over scheduling priority for the rest.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adoptionpath">Adoption path</h3>

<p>Markup based signal should be added in a way such that non-supporting browsers will simply ignore them and load all resources,
  potentially not in the intended priority and dependency. Script based signaling APIs should be created in a way that non-supporting
  browsers simply ignore the signals.</p>

<h2 id="outofscope">Out of scope</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Signal that certain images should not block the load event</li>

  <li>Signals relating the script execution order, script execution grouping, execution dependency, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>We propose to address the above use-cases using the following concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will define a new attribute called <code>importance</code> which informs the browser of the importance a developer intends for a resource to have.</li>
  <li>This attribute will have three states that will map to current browser priorities:
    <ul>
      <li><code>high</code> - The developer considers the resource as being high priority. </li>
      <li>
        <code>low</code> - The developer considers the resource as being low priority.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>auto</code> - The developer does not indicate a preference. This also serves as the default value if the attribute is not specified.
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Developers would annotate resource requesting tags
  such as <code>script</code> and <code>link</code> using the <code>importance</code> attribute as a hint of the preferred priority with which the resource should be fetched.</li>

  <li>Developers would be able to specify that certain
  resources are more or less important than others using this attribute. It would act as a hint of the intended
  priority rather than an instruction to the browser.</li>

</ul>

<p>With this attribute, the browser should make an effort to respect the developer's preference for the importance
  of a resource when fetching it. Note that this is intentionally weak language, allowing for a browser to apply its own preferences for resource priority or heuristics if deemed important.
</p>

<p>This is how we conceptually think about different resource types under the hood in browsers today. It may translate well
  to user-space where different types of content share similar properties.</p>
</section>

  <section>
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>This section outlines the different use-cases this effort sets to address. It is worth noting that priority in these examples
  should not limit itself to network priority (i.e. request time and HTTP/2 dependencies and weights), but also to processing
  priority, as the browser can use the same signals in order to avoid processing of low priority resource in favor of higher
  priority ones.</p>

<h3 id="communicateresourceimportancetothebrowser">Communicate resource importance to the browser</h3>

<p>The browser assigns priorities and certain dependencies to downloaded resources and uses them to determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the resource's request is sent to the server.</li>

  <li>What HTTP/2 dependencies and weights are assigned to the resource's request.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The browser uses various heuristics in order to do the above, which are based on the type of resource, its location in the
  document and more.</p>

<p>Occasionally, web developers are in a better position to know which resources are more impactful than others on their users'
  loading experience, and need a way to communicate that to the browser.</p>


<h3 id="signalaresourceasnoncritical">Signal a resource as non-critical</h3>

<p>Using
  <code>&lt;link rel=preload&gt;</code> in order to get the browser to early discover certain resources, especially in its header form, means that the browser
  may discover these resources before other, more critical resources and send their request to the server first. This can
  result in loading regressions as the server may start sending those non-critical resources before other, more critical
  ones, which may fill up the TCP socket, sending queues. While better transport protocols (e.g. QUIC) may address that at
  a lower layer for the single origin case, developers should be able to signal to the browser that a certain resource is
  not critical, and therefore should be queued until such resources are discovered. Such marking as "non-critical" should
  be orthogonal to the signaling of the resource's "importance" (e.g. this could be applied to high priority resources that
  shouldn't contend with rendering-critical resources as well as low priority ones).</p>

<h3 id="avoidbandwidthcontentioninmultipleoriginscenarios">Avoid bandwidth contention in multiple origin scenarios</h3>

<p>When loading resources from multiple origins, setting HTTP/2 dependencies and weights do very little to avoid bandwidth contention
  between the origins, as each origin tries to send down its most critical resource without knowing of more critical resources
  in other origins. Signaling resource importance to the browser can enable it to defer sending of non-critical third party
  requests while critical resources are still being downloaded.</p>

<h3 id="provideprioritysignalsformarkupbasedresources">Provide priority signals for markup-based resources</h3>

<p>Developers need a way to provide the above signals for resources that are loaded through markup (or through markup-equivalent
  HTTP headers, e.g.
  <code>Link:</code>)</p>

<h3 id="provideprioritysignalsfordynamicallyloadedresources">Provide priority signals for dynamically loaded resources</h3>

<p>Developers need a way to provide the above signals for resources that are fetched through JavaScript, e.g. using the
  <code>fetch()</code> API. That would enable them both to upgrade and downgrade those resource's "importance".
</p>

<h3 id="providetheabilitytoreprioritizearesourceinflight">Provide the ability to re-prioritize a resource in-flight</h3>

<ul>
  <li>"Resource priority" is not always the right way of looking at it. For resources that are parsed on-the-fly (most notably
    HTML and progressive images), their first buffer is often more important than their last. Developers can use the ability
    to reprioritize resources to reflect that when downloading such resources.</li>

  <li>There are also cases where the priority of a resource changes due to user action or condition changes. One example is the
    loading of images, where in-viewport images (or soon-to-be in-viewport images) are of higher priority than images that
    are further away from the viewport and therefore less likely to be seen by the user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="downgradepriorityofaniframeanditssubresources">Downgrade priority of an iframe and its subresources</h3>

<p>When developers load a third party iframe, they may wish to make sure that it does not contend on bandwidth and/or CPU with
  the more important first party content of the page. Alternatively, they may wish to signal the browser that a certain third
  party iframe is as important as the main page content and should be given CPU and bandwidth resources accordingly.
</p>

<p>When such a signal is applied to an iframe, it should be equally applied to all the subresources that the iframe loads.</p>
