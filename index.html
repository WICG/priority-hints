    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
    </p>
    <p>The browser's resource loading process is a complex one. Browsers discover needed resources and download them according
      to their heuristic priority. Browsers may also use this heuristic resource priority to delay sending certain requests
      in order to avoid bandwidth contention of these resources with more critical ones.</p>

    <p>Currently web developers have very little control over the heuristic importance of loaded resources, other than speeding
      up their discovery using
      <code>&lt;link rel=preload&gt;</code>. Browsers make many assumptions on the importance of resources based on the resource's type (AKA its request destination),
      and its location in the containing document.</p>

    <p>This document will detail use cases and a markup sketch that will provide developers with the control to indicate a resource's
      relative importance to the browser, and enable the browser to act on those indications to modify the time it sends
      out the request and its HTTP/2 dependency/weight so that important resources are fetched and used earlier, in order
      to improve the user's experience.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

    <p>The
      <code>importance</code> attribute may be used with elements including link, img, script and iframe. This keyword hints to the browser the
      relative fetch priority a developer intends for a resource to have.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The
        <code>importance</code> attribute will have three states that will map to current browser priorities:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>high</code> - The developer considers the resource as being high priority.</li>
          <li>
            <code>low</code> - The developer considers the resource as being low priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>auto</code> - The developer does not indicate a preference. This also serves as the default value if the attribute is not
            specified.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Developers would annotate resource-requesting tags such as
        <code>script</code> and
        <code>link</code> using the
        <code>importance</code> attribute as a hint of the preferred priority with which the resource should be fetched.</li>

      <li>Developers would be able to specify that certain resources are more or less important than others using this attribute.
        It would act as a hint of the intended priority rather than an instruction to the browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this attribute, the browser should make an effort to respect the developer's preference for the importance of a
      resource when fetching it. Note that this is intentionally weak language, allowing for a browser to apply its own preferences
      for resource priority or heuristics if deemed important.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Priority Hints compliment existing browser loading primitives such as preload. Preload is a mandatory and high-priority
          fetch for a resource that is necessary for the current navigation. Priority Hints can hint resource priority should
          be lower or higher than it is by default and can also be used to provide more granular prioritization to preloads.</p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>This is how we conceptually think about different resource types under the hood in browsers today. It may translate well
      to user-space where different types of content share similar properties.</p>

    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

    <p>Browsers make a best-effort to assign a reasonable fetch priority to images so those in-viewport appear as soon as possible.
      In many cases, this will not cause issues, however, what if some above-the-fold imagery is not as critical as others?
      Priority Hints can assist here. </p>

    <div class="example" title="Example 1">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have a carousel of images at the top of a page with the first image visible and the remaining images
        images off screen. The markup of this carousel may reasonable the following:</p>
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;ul class=&quot;carousel&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;!-- The first image is visible --&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-1.jpg&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;!-- The other carousel images are not --&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-2.jpg&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-3.jpg&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-4.jpg&quot;&gt;
<br/>&lt;/ul&gt;
</div>

<p>Browser heuristics may cause all four images to be fetched with a high priprity, despite three of them not initially being visible. This may cause these fetches to delay the first image from completing fetching or contend with fetches for other in-viewport resources.</p>
<p>A developer could use rel=preload to preload the first image in the carousel, however doing so may not provide the outcome one expects: rel=preload will effectively prioritize that image above everything else, and if that image is large, it may block rendering as even stylesheets may end up waiting for that image to complete downloading. Priority Hints may help here.</p>

<div class="example" title="Example 1">
<pre highlight="html">
&lt;ul class=&quot;carousel&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;!-- The first image is visible --&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-1.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;!-- The other carousel images are not --&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-2.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-3.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;
<br/> &lt;img src=&quot;img/carousel-4.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;
<br/>&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>When we assign the off-screen images low priority, this will create less contention between the remaining high priority
      images and other high priority resources.</p>

    <p>Async JavaScript files may be loaded by default with low priority, but some of them may be of high priority and should
      be loaded at the same time as the page's render blocking resources. Developers currently use
      <a href="https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/900445266750263296">hacks</a> to address that use-case.</p>
    <div class="example" title="Example 1">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have a web app with a mix of async scripts that are critical and non-critical to the initial experience.
        They want to signify the importance of these resources to the browser. They can accomplish this by annotating these
        requests with the `importance` attribute:
      </p>
      <p>The browser will attempt to fetch main.js with a high priority and the other scripts with a lower priority.</p>
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script src=&quot;main.js&quot; async importance=&quot;high&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;non-critical-1.js&quot; async importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;non-critical-2.js&quot; async importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Third party resources (e.g scripts from ads) are often loaded with medium/high priority, but developers may wish to load
      them all at low priority. Similarly, developers may wish to load all first-party resources that are critical with a
      high priority.
    </p>
    <div class="example" title="Example 2">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have a page that includes a number of
        <b>third party</b> resources which are not-critical to first paint. They would like to signify to the browser that the
        importance of these resources is low so that requests for them don't contend with network requests for more important
        resources. They can accomplish this by annotating these requests with an `importance` of `low`:
      </p>
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script src=&quot;https://foo.com/non-critical.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://foo.com/ads.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://foo.com/footer.css&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>


    <p>Markup images are typically loaded with low priority, but may be critical to the user experience, so for certain images,
      the developer may want to indicate that their importance only falls short of the page's render blocking resources.
      A prominent example of that is the page's image in an image sharing site, where the image is the main content users
      are looking for. Another example is a single-page-app where route fetches must run at highest priority.</p>
    <div class="example" title="Example 3">
      <p>FastCorp Inc. have an image sharing section of their site where individual images have their own dedicated pages. Although
        there are several resources loaded for each of these pages, the image is the main content users are interested in.
        Related images are the next most important. They want to indicate this importance to the browser:
      </p>
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;family.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;related&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;graduation.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;wedding.jpg&quot; importance=&quot;high&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;social-buttons.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;analytics.js&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    <ul>


      <li>Blocking scripts are often of high priority (depends on their location in the page and other heuristics), yet sometimes
        developers want to avoid them interfering with e.g., loading of viewport images.</li>

      <li>When developers download a group of resources as a result of user interaction, those resources' download priorities
        don't take into account the eventual usage and importance of those resources. Developers may wish to load these resources
        with priorities and dependencies which better represent their usage and the user's needs.</li>

      <li>Single-page applications can kick off multiple API requests to bootstrap the user experience. Developers may wish to
        load critical API requests at a high priority and have better control over scheduling priority for the rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Priority Hints can be used to lower the priority of non-critical Fetch API requests to avoid them contending with more
      important ones.
    </p>

    <p>A news site making a critical Fetch API request for article content might end up contending with requests for less important
      resources like related content.</p>

    <div class="example" title="Example 4">
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script&gt;
<br/> // Critical Fetch request for article content
<br/> fetch('/api/articles.json').then(/*...*/)
<br/>
<br/> // Request for related content contending with the above request
<br/> fetch('/api/related.json').then(/*...*/)
<br/>&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>By using the
      <code>importance</code> attribute on the second Fetch request, we can hint that the priority of that request is
      <code>low</code>, reducing the chances of it contending with the Fetch request for article content. We can also explicitly state the
      priority of the first request is
      <code>high</code> so that browsers where Fetch requests do not already have a high priority know that it is important to the page.</p>

    <div class="example" title="Example 5">
      <pre highlight="html">
&lt;script&gt;
<br/> // Critical Fetch request for article content
<br/> fetch('/api/articles.json', { importance: 'high' }).then(/*...*/)
<br/>
<br/> // Request for related content now reduced in priority
<br/> // reducing the opportunity for contention
<br/> fetch('/api/related.json', { importance: 'low' }).then(/*...*/)
<br/>&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>This might be more pronounced on HTTP 1.1 with the impact being more visible with HTTP/2 multiplexing if a large number
      of Fetch requests are being made and are contending with one another. </p>
    <p>The importance hint may be specified in the document markup, MAY be provided via JavaScript, MAY be provided via the
      HTTP header, and MAY be dynamically added to the document.</p>
    <div class="example" title="Example 5">
      <pre highlight="html">Link: &lt;/app/style.css&gt;; importance=high<br/>
Link: &lt;/app/script.js&gt;; importance=low</pre>
    </div>

    <p>As above examples illustrate, importance can be specified via declarative markup, Link HTTP header ([
      <cite>
        <a class="bibref" href="#bib-RFC5988">RFC5988</a>
      </cite>]), or scheduled via JavaScript.</p>

    <h2 id="adoptionpath">Adoption path</h2>

    <p>Markup-based signals should be added in a way such that non-supporting browsers will simply ignore them and load all
      resources, potentially not with the intended priority and dependency. Script-based signaling APIs should be created
      in a way that non-supporting browsers simply ignore the signals.</p>

    <h2 id="outofscope">Out of scope</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Signal that certain images should not block the load event</li>

      <li>Signals relating the script execution order, script execution grouping, execution dependency, etc</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>

    <p>This section outlines the different use-cases Priority Hints sets out to address. It is worth noting that priority in
      these examples should not limit itself to network priority (i.e. request time and HTTP/2 dependencies and weights),
      but also to processing priority, as the browser can use the same signals in order to avoid processing of low priority
      resource in favor of higher priority ones.</p>

    <h3 id="communicateresourceimportancetothebrowser">Communicate resource importance to the browser</h3>

    <p>The browser assigns priorities and certain dependencies to downloaded resources and uses them to determine:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When the resource's request is sent to the server.</li>

      <li>What HTTP/2 dependencies and weights are assigned to the resource's request.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The browser uses various heuristics in order to do the above, which are based on the type of resource, its location in
      the document, and more.</p>

    <p>Occasionally, web developers are in a better position to know which resources are more impactful than others on their
      users' loading experience, and need a way to communicate that to the browser.</p>


    <h3 id="signalaresourceasnoncritical">Signal a resource as non-critical</h3>

    <p>Using
      <code>&lt;link rel=preload&gt;</code> in order to get the browser to early-discover certain resources, especially in its header form, means that the browser
      may discover these resources before other, more critical resources and send their request to the server first. That
      can result in loading regressions as the server may start sending those non-critical resources before other, more critical
      ones, which may fill up the TCP socket sending queues.</p>
    <p>While better transport protocols (e.g. QUIC) may address that at a lower layer for the single origin case, developers
      should be able to signal to the browser that a certain resource is not critical, and therefore should be queued until
      such resources are discovered. Such marking as "non-critical" should be orthogonal to the signaling of the resource's
      "importance" (e.g. this could be applied to high priority resources that shouldn't contend with rendering-critical
      resources as well as low priority ones).</p>

    <h3 id="avoidbandwidthcontentioninmultipleoriginscenarios">Avoid bandwidth contention in multiple origin scenarios</h3>

    <p>When loading resources from multiple origins, setting HTTP/2 dependencies and weights do very little to avoid bandwidth
      contention between the origins, as each origin tries to send down its most critical resource without knowing of more
      critical resources in other origins. Signaling resource importance to the browser can enable it to defer sending of
      non-critical third party requests while critical resources are still being downloaded.</p>

    <h3 id="provideprioritysignalsformarkupbasedresources">Provide priority signals for markup-based resources</h3>

    <p>Developers need a way to provide the above signals for resources that are loaded through markup (or through markup-equivalent
      HTTP headers, e.g.
      <code>Link:</code>)</p>

    <h3 id="provideprioritysignalsfordynamicallyloadedresources">Provide priority signals for dynamically loaded resources</h3>

    <p>Developers need a way to provide the above signals for resources that are fetched through JavaScript, e.g., using the
      <code>fetch()</code> API. That would enable them both to upgrade and downgrade those resource's "importance".
    </p>

    <h3 id="providetheabilitytoreprioritizearesourceinflight">Provide the ability to re-prioritize a resource in-flight</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>"Resource priority" is not always the right way of looking at it. For resources that are parsed on-the-fly (most notably
        HTML and progressive images), their first buffer is often more important than their last. Developers can use the
        ability to reprioritize resources to reflect this notion when downloading such resources.</li>

      <li>There are also cases where the priority of a resource changes due to user action or condition changes. One example
        is the loading of images, where in-viewport images (or soon-to-be in-viewport images) are of higher priority than
        images that are further away from the viewport and therefore less likely to be seen by the user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="downgradepriorityofaniframeanditssubresources">Downgrade priority of an iframe and its subresources</h3>

    <p>When developers load a third party iframe, they may wish to make sure that it does not contend on bandwidth and/or CPU
      with the more important first party content of the page. Alternatively, they may wish to signal the browser that a
      certain third party iframe is as important as the main page content and should be given CPU and bandwidth resources
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>When such a signal is applied to an iframe, it should be equally applied to all the subresources that the iframe loads.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-dfn-for="safety">
    <h2>Safe usage</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <p>If the
        <code>importance</code> keyword is used as an optimization to initiate earlier fetch then no additional feature detection checks are necessary:
        browsers that support
        <code>importance</code> may initiate earlier fetch, and those that do not will ignore it and fetch the resource as previously. Otherwise,
        if the application intends to rely on
        <code>importance</code> to fetch the resource, then it can execute a feature detection check to verify that it is supported.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>Applying
      <code>importance</code> to the resources in a page should never degrade performance. This should hold true for both browsers that support
      Priority Hints as well as browsers that do not. UAs are free to apply other heuristics in addition to Priority Hints
      to decide on how they load content.</p>
    <p>With in-viewport images, a browser may automatically detect if the image is important and boost priority if it gets to
      layout early enough. However, all browsers would benefit from knowing which images an author wants to load "earlier"
      and which are safe to load "later", regardless of how they use this information.</p>
    <p>This same logic applies for scripts. Browsers may have different heuristics that work differently across browsers for
      scripts (e.g with
      <code>async</code>,
      <code>defer</code>) but a site could fix any misguesses across the board by being explicit using Priority Hints.</p>
